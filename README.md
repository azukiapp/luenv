# Simple Lua Version Management: luenv

luenv lets you easily switch between multiple versions of Lua. It's
simple, unobtrusive, and follows the UNIX tradition of single-purpose
tools that do one thing well.

This project is based on project [rbenv](http://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv).

### luenv _doesâ€¦_

* Let you **change the global Lua version** on a per-user basis.
* Provide support for **per-project Lua versions**.
* Allow you to **override the Lua version** with an environment
  variable.
